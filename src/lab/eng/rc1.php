	<h3 align="center"><b>Read the following passage carefully and the solve the questions that follow:</b></h3>
					<p align="justify">At the twilight hour, she tiptoes down surreptitiously. Walking carefully to stifle that irritable clicking 								sound of her stylish high heels, she slithers snake-like, down the smooth marble steps. </p>
							<p align="justify">Her careful movements have not been reflected in anybody's eyes. This certainty has led her 								downstairs from a beautiful room in a three storeyed building. She makes her way through the traffic, crosses the 								highway and jumps over that crack on the pavement, not paying attention to the possible danger lurking there. She 								knocks softly, twice, on my closed door. I move quickly and 	open the door. Draped in a blue sari, her face like a 							full moon, she looks at me and the words from her unmoving lips create a tremor inside my ear. I do not understand anything, 								yet I know. She does not say anything, yet she speaks. I call her inside, “Andromeda, come ..."</p>
						<p align="justify">I have chosen this name for her, for the time being, from among myriad other names I had found after 						poring over books on astrology. I had fixed my search on the universe, I had scanned the history of time with the help of 						Stephen Hawkings's A Brief History of Time and I cannot think of any other name sweeter, lighter, more apt than “Andromeda."</p>
<p align="justify">The universe, the stars, nebula, the Milky Way – all are moving away from each other, but my sweet Andromeda comes closer to me. I lead her gently to the armchair with the broken armrest and say, "Sit here."</p>
<p align="justify">She looks at me, hesitating and doubtful. Inaudibly she utters something. I am not even trying to understand it. Let her sit silently and get used to this new situation and environment. She will then speak freely without any fear or hesitation. I will gaze at her, watch her lips tremble and wonder how the words coming out of her sweet lips form meanings. Her words rain on me, wounding me with a strange emotion and sensation. There is no supernatural attribute in my feelings that would make her unnecessarily aware of it, stop her torrent of words or make the unfettered motion of love stumble.</p>
<p align="justify">I have restrained myself with difficulty, the effort at self-control inducing the vital glands of my body to secrete hormones. A few beads of sweat appear clearly on my forehead. I try to convince her with unspoken words that nothing has happened – you have just visited me like a good neighbour. There is nothing new about it, nothing unexpected or unusual ...</p>
<p align="justify">And yet, there is. For me, it is an unusual incident but I had expected it. All this time I have been waiting with such hopes and expectations. I knew something like this would happen one day. Andromeda, Ranjana or whatever other name she is called by – she will come one day and knock at my old, peeling, wooden door. Fighting her way through the traffic, she will find my house. She will come from that three storeyed building across the street and introduce herself like a good neighbour. I will keep looking at her shy, demure form and we will talk to our heart's content. Outside, the moonlight will frolic and I will go out with her for a stroll. In the gentle breeze in the park, we will forget the mad noise and the scream of traffic.</p>
