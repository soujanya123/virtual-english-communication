Lab facilities for effective learning of English and Communication Skills do not exist in many institutions of higher learning over different areas of the country. The proposed simulation-based Virtual English and Communication Skills Lab with Computer-aided Learning will address this gap. It will develop a virtual platform through which students of Engineering (and other) institutions will be able to carry out experiments and interactive learning in the subject with ease.  The rapid developments in computer-aided learning tools in the area of Humanities Computing are today harnessed by many universities abroad to help students develop their communication skills, an area that needs to be given its due importance. This facility needs to be brought to our students to help them in developing their English and communication skills, a subject that is taught in all undergraduate engineering institutes. The Virtual Lab will be developed as a collaborative and interdisciplinary effort at IIT Guwahati in an effort to create computer-aided experimental and instructional tools as well as self-learning and self-appraisal kits for students in the use of English and communication skills.
